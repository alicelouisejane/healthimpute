\title{Flag Implausible Anthropometric Values (with LMS z-score or limits depending on age)}
\usage{
flag_anthro(data, variable, patient_id_col, sex_col, age_col)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{A data frame with sex, age (in years), and anthropometric variable(s).}

\item{variable}{Variable to evaluate (must contain 'weight', 'height', or 'bmi').}

\item{patient_id_col}{Column name for patient ID.}

\item{sex_col}{Column name for sex.}

\item{age_col}{Column name for age in years.}
}
\value{
Data frame with z-score and converted percentile where possible and implausibility flag columns for the specified variable.
For individuals aged 20 years or younger, values are flagged if the absolute z-score exceeds 4 or -4.
For those over 20 years old, BMI is flagged if it is less than 14 or greater than 50,
weight is flagged if it is less than 30 kg or greater than 180 kg,
and height is flagged if it is less than 120 cm or greater than 210 cm.

Computes LMS-based z-scores and flags biologically implausible anthropometric values (weight, height, or BMI)
for individuals across the full age spectrum, using CDC growth charts for those â‰¤20 years.
