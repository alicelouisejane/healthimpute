Description: Provides imputation tools for longitudinal clinical datasets:
    (1) 'impute_anthro()' imputes pediatric weight, height, or BMI using interpolated
    CDC growth chart percentiles via the LMS method.
    (2) 'impute_timewindow()' performs time-window-based forward or backward
    imputation of missing values in biomarkers or clinical metrics, using a configurable window (default 30 days).
    The anthropometric imputation method is based on the CDC growth charts and follows approaches
    aligned with those described in PMID: 35308906.
    These tools are designed for longitudinal clinical research datasets where minimising missingness is of importance.
